                In the 18th and 19th Century journeyman decorators would make their own paint using milk, earth pigments, clay and lime. Modern versions replicate the properties of the historical Milk Paint using a very small amount of an Acylic medium rather than whole milk. Milk paint performs quite differently to modern Vinyl Emulsions which are not suited to decorative paint finishes as the Vinyl forms a plastic skin inhibiting finishing.

                Grand Illusions Vintage Paint not only emulates the colours of the past, with a range of 27 colours inspired by a Nordic-French palette, but also the characteristics of those paints. It gives a truly chalky, matt, breathable finish, perfect for walls, especially in older non cavity wall properties, and ideally suited to shabby chic and other decorative paint finishes.
                <br /><br />
                Conventional painting of bare wood requires a primer, 2 undercoats and a Top Coat. Milk Paint is self priming and requires no separate undercoat, so just one can of paint is required. It is tremendously forgiving and easy to apply. Any spills, even when dry, can be cleared up with a damp cloth.

                It is very difficult to show colours truly through a computer screen as each machine's interpretation of the colour may vary slightly. The on line colour chart is intended to be used only as a guide.
